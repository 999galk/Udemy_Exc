Git Bash:

- Run sublime text from there:
1. alias is kept in .bashrc file (from home directory) : alias subl = "C/Sublime_Text/sublime_text.exe". Run it with subl from terminal

- Git
1. clone a reposetory using git clone http address
* The following commands will be available only from the cloned directory:
3. git pull - pulls the latest version of the files from git
2. git status - shows you files that are different from what is live in master
3. git add - used either to add a specific file : "git add file/dir name" or to add all the files you see in git status : "git add ."
4. git commit -m "messege"
5. git push - pushes the changes to git, will now be latest version of the files in git

Branchs:
1. git branch - shows you all the exsiting branches, the one your in is marked in green
2. git branch "branch name" - will create a new branch
3. git checkout "branch name" - will change the active branch to be this one
* You can combine the two : "git checkout -b "new branch name""
4. All the above workflow (status, comming, push) 
* git diff - shows the differance between the changed files to the origin
5. There will be a new pull request in git where you can comment and see the changes
6. merge the pull request into master -> usually by team leader 
7. Delete branch - if you won't use it again its better to keep it clean and delete it
8. merge master - from your brench you can "git merge master" which is like "pull" only from branches.
If you have conflicts it will show up in your sublimeText file - >>head till === is what exist in your file, line until >>master is what exist on master
